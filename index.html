			<h2 id='itemName' style="text-align: right; padding-right: 40px;">Ancient Forces Ring</h2>
			<p id='itemDescription' style="width: 100%;;">This delicate ring was created from thin electrical wire and a single bead. The plastic coating was stripped from the wire, and then the wire was hammered to flatten it out. Next it was heated with a gas torch to discolor the metal. After the metal was quenched in water, it was shaped into the ring you see here. The intent of this piece was to resemble an ancient artifact, and like a historical treasure, it needs to be handled with care. The thin copper is very maliable and could easily be crushed if not handled gently.</p>

		<h2>About</h2>

		<p style='font-style: italic;'>Making use of useless things.<p>


		<p> Since I was a child, I was creating treasures from trash, long before "upcycling" was even a word. It began when I was around 6 years old. My friend and I started a "recycling club" where we made clever creations out of the castaways that adults didn't seem to want: clothespins, paperclips, plastic utensils, broken things of all sorts.. <br>
		My mother was both horrified that we were playing "with garbage," and also impressed at our enginuity and creativity. Resoursefulness is something we both admired. (I can still remember my amazement when we watched episodes of MacGuyver together!)
		<br>
		I've never stopped making use of refuse, and seeking out beauty within the mundane. It's how I live, how I experience the world, and how I wish to share my ideas.
